I"v<p>Lagrangian Multipliers is a concept commonly taught in Calculus III classes. It’s an amazing mathematical tool that allows you to find the local extrema of any function under a constraint. While it is an incredibly useful tool to have in a mathemetician’s toolkit, in my experience, very few students actually understand how it works. Yes, you set the gradient of the function you’re optimizing equal to some multiplier times the gradient of your constraint, and solving the resulting system gives you the local extrema. But why does that work? In this post, I hope to provide some intuition to answer that question.</p>
