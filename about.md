# About
Hi, I'm Bhaskar. I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Florida with an interest in Machine Learning and AI. I'm passionate about learning and am excited to see where the future takes me. In my free time, you'll most likely see me reading, rock climbing, or playing tetris.

“Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.” - Richard Feynman
