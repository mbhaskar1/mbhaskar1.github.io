# About
Hi, I'm Bhaskar. I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley advised by Stuart Russell. I'm still very much trying to figure out what I'd like to work on during my time in Berkeley, but my current research interests are in knowledge representation, probabilistic programming, and cognitive architectures. In my free time, you'll most likely see me reading philosophy, rock climbing, or playing tetris.
