## Introduction
\include image of support vector machine graphed\

Over the past couple of days, I've been spending the majority of my time really learning the theory behind Support Vector Machines (SVMs). I've come across many useful resources including the [MIT OCW video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PwhiWxHK8o) on the subject and the almighty Wikipedia for learning about concepts like [Karush-Kuhn-Tucker Conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush%E2%80%93Kuhn%E2%80%93Tucker_conditions), [Wolfe Duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfe_duality), and more. I would personally recommend checking out all of those links, as the MIT video provides a nice walkthrough for the math of SVMs and the Wikipedia links clarify the inner workings of that math.

*Side Note:* While the MIT video is a great resource and was really useful in getting a feel for the math, the professor does makes a simplification when applying Lagrange Multipliers. He sets the constraint for the function to be $y_i(\vec{w}\cdot \vec{x_i} + b) - 1 = 0$. Obviously, this isn't necessarily true for all $i$ as it is not necessary for all points to be on the margin of the SVM. The constraint is actually the inequality, $y_i(\vec{w}\cdot \vec{x_i} + b) - 1 \geq 0$. That's the reason KKT (Karush-Kuhn-Tucker) conditions are applied to the problem, and it's the reason the professor applies the constraint, $\lambda_i \geq 0$.

After developing somewhat of an understanding of the algorithm, my first project was to create an actual implementation of the SVM algorithm. Though it didn't end up being entirely from scratch as I used CVXOPT to solve the convex optimization problem, the implementation helped me better understand how the algorithm worked and ... . In this post, I hope to walk you through that implementation. Note that this post assumes an understanding of the underlying math behind SVMs. If you feel uncomfortable on that front, I would again recommend checking out the resources linked above.

## The Optimization Problem

Anyways, with that out of the way, let's get into it! For starters, what is the actual problem we're trying to solve here? Yes, we want to find the "maximum-margin hyperplane" that separates our two classes, but how do we formalize that goal mathematically? Well, we've already seen the following optimization problem:

$$\textrm{min}\,\frac{1}{2}||\vec{w}||^2\quad \textrm{given} \quad \sum_i^m y_i(\vec{w}\cdot \vec{x_i} + b) - 1 \geq 0$$

We've seen how we can apply KKT to this problem to in turn get the following Lagrangian Function and constraint:

$$L=\frac{1}{2}||\vec{w}||^2 - \sum_i^m \lambda_i\left[y_i(\vec{w}\cdot \vec{x_i} + b) - 1\right] \quad \textrm{given} \quad \lambda_i \geq 0$$

And we've seen how, taking the partial derivative of $L$ with respect to $\vec{w}$ and $b$, and using them in the equation above, can lead us to the following dual representation of the optimization problem

$$\textrm{maximize} \:\: L_D = \sum_i^m \lambda_i  - \frac{1}{2}\sum_i^m \sum_j^m \lambda_i \lambda_j y_i y_j (\vec{x_i}\cdot\vec{x_j}) \quad \textrm{given}\quad \sum_i^m\lambda_iy_i=0,\:\lambda_i\geq0$$

Now this is a very nice way to represent the problem. The only unknowns in the problem are the $\lambda$'s and if you solve for the ones that maximize $L_D$, you get the solution to our optimization problem. Our $\lambda$'s can be used to calculate $b$ and in turn, the decision boundary for our SVM. So now we just pass our optimization problem to the computer and let it solve it, right? Well, there's actually a little more prepping to do.

## CVXOPT Requirements

The thing is, algorithms that solve convex optimization problems like the one we have hereÂ¹, often require the problem in a specific format. Specifically, in the case of CVXOPT, it wants convex optimization problems that it can minimize. It also requires the optimization problem to be in the following format:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\textrm{minimize} & \frac{1}{2}x^TPx+q^Tx\\
&\textrm{subject to} & Gx\preceq h\\
& & Ax=b
\end{aligned}
$$

Now this seems daunting at first, and I admit it seemed confusing to me as well, but upon closer examination, these expressions are actually very straight-forward.

Before we tackle them, however, let's deal with the glaring problem with our optimization problem. CVXOPT requires that the problem be a minimization problem, whereas our problem is designed to be maximized. This can actually be easily fixed by simply multiplying our Lagrangian function by $-1$, creating the following optimization problem:

$$\textrm{minimize} \:\: L_D = \frac{1}{2}\sum_i^m \sum_j^m \lambda_i \lambda_j y_i y_j (\vec{x_i}\cdot\vec{x_j}) -\sum_i^m\lambda_i\quad \textrm{given}\quad \sum_i^m\lambda_iy_i=0,\:\lambda_i\geq0$$

Multiplying by $-1$ reflects all values of the $L_D$ function making positive's negative and negative's positive, resulting in the function's global maximum, becoming a global minimum.

Now let's put our optimization problem in the form above. Let's start by looking at the $\frac{1}{2}x^TPx$ term. If you calculate the value of this expression in terms of the individual elements of the relevant matrices, you get the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2}x^TPx&=
\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}x_1 & x_2 & \dots & x_m\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}P_{11} & P_{12} & \dots & P_{1m}\\ P_{21} & P_{22}\\ \vdots & & \ddots \\ P_{m1} & & & P_{mm}\end{bmatrix}\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix}\\
&= \frac{1}{2}(x_1^2\cdot P_{11} + x_1x_2\cdot P_{12} + x_2x_1 \cdot P_{21} + x_2^2\cdot P_{22} + \dots )\\
&=\frac{1}{2}\sum_i^m\sum_j^m x_ix_j\cdot P_{ij}
\end{aligned}
$$

With this, we see that the $\frac{1}{2}x^TPx$ term represents all of the second-order variables in the function that needs to be minimized (in our case, the Lagrangian function). We also see that $P$ is the matrix that satisfies the condition that $\frac{1}{2}\sum_i^m\sum_j^m x_ix_j\cdot P_{ij}$ is equal to the portion of the Lagrangian function with second-order variables. In our specific case, this portion is $\sum_i^m \sum_j^m \lambda_i \lambda_j y_i y_j (x_i\cdot x_j)$. Note that $\lambda_i$ and $\lambda_j$ represent the $x_i$ and $x_j$ in our problem as they are the unknowns. Using this, we get the following definition for $P$

$$\frac{1}{2}\sum_i^m\sum_j^m \lambda_i\lambda_j\cdot P_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_i^m \sum_j^m \lambda_i \lambda_j y_i y_j (x_i\cdot x_j)\quad \Rightarrow \quad P_{ij} = y_iy_j(x_i\cdot x_j)$$

In a similar fashion, we see that the $q^Tx$ term represents all of the first-order variables in the Lagrangian function. We derive the following definition for $q$ in our problem:

$$q^T\lambda=\sum_i^m q_i\lambda_i=-\sum_i^m \lambda_i \quad \Rightarrow \quad q_i=-1$$

The $Gx \preceq h$ expression is a linear matrix inequality similar to the form of standard linear matrix equations. It represents any inequality constraints in the optimization problem. In our case, these constraints are $\lambda_i \geq 0$ for all $i$ from $0$ to $m$. These constraints can be rewritten as $-\lambda_i \leq 0$ to use the less than or equal to symbol. That gives us the following matrices for $G$ and $h$:

$$G = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & \dots  & 0\\ 
0 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1  & & \vdots\\
\vdots & & & \ddots \\
0 & & \dots & & -1
\end{bmatrix} \quad
b=
\begin{bmatrix}
0\\0\\ \vdots \\ 0
\end{bmatrix}$$

Finally, the $Ax=b$ expression is your standard linear matrix equation and it represents any equality constraints in the optimization problem. In our case, we have a single equation, $\sum_i^m \lambda_i yi = 0$. With that constraint, we get the following matrices for $A$ and $b$:

$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}y_1 & y_2 & \dots & y_m\end{bmatrix} \quad b=\begin{bmatrix}0\end{bmatrix}
$$

With matrices for $P$, $q$, $G$, $h$, $A$, and $b$, and a minimizable optimization problem, we are now ready to computationally solve our SVM problem.

## The Code - Linear SVM

We'll start off by importing our relevant modules and creating a basic class for our SVM:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from cvxopt import matrix, solvers

class SVM:
	def __init__(self):
		self.lambdas = np.array([])
		self.b = 0
		self.m = 0
	
	def fit(self, X, y):
		pass
	
	def predict(self, x):
		pass
	
	def plot(self, X, y):
		pass
```

We've initialized our `lambdas`, `b`, and `m` for later use, and have created the functions `fit(self, X, y)`,  `predict(self, x)`, and `plot(self, X, y)`. The `fit` function will be used to set `lambdas` and `b` to the appropriate values for the data set, the `predict` function will return the predicted class of a given data point, and the `plot` function will create a visual plot of the SVM.

### The Fit Function

Let's start by implementing the `fit` function. First we need to calculate our $P$, $q$, $G$, $h$, $A$, and $b$ matrices:

```python
def fit(self, X, y):
	self.m = X.shape[0]
	P = np.empty((self.m, self.m))
	for i in range(self.m):
		for j in range(self.m):
			P[i, j] = y[i]*y[j]*np.dot(X[i], X[j])
	q = -np.ones((self.m, 1))
	G = -np.eye(self.m)
	h = np.zeros((self.m, 1))
	A = y.reshape((1, self.m))
	b = np.zeros((1, 1))
```

With this, we have all our matrices initialized with `self.m` set to the amount of data points in `X`. Note that `np.eye(m)` gives you an $m\times m$ matrix with $1$'s down the diagonal (also called the $m\times m$ identity matrix). That way `-np.eye(self.m)` returns the matrix we want for `G`.

Now, with the matrices set, we need to put convert them to the CVXOPT module's matrices as the module only reads those objects, and can't read numpy matrices. This is easy to do as you can convert a numpy matrix to a CVXOPT matrix by doing `matrix(numpy_matrix)`:

```python
def fit(self, X, y):
	...
	P = matrix(P)
	q = matrix(q)
	G = matrix(G)
	h = matrix(h)
	A = matrix(A.astype('double'))
	b = matrix(b)
```

We modify `A` to be a matrix with type 'double' because it initially contains integers from the `y` matrix, whereas CVXOPT requires numbers in the form of doubles. The rest of the matrices contain doubles by default, and therefore, don't require that conversion.

With all the conversions done, we simply need to pass the matrices to CVXOPT to solve the optimization problem. We'll specifically use the function `solvers.qp(P, q, G, h, A, b)`

```python
def fit(self, X, y):
	...
	sol = solvers.qp(P, q, G, h, A, b)
	self.lambdas = sol['x'].reshape((m, 1))
```

Now that we have the lambdas, we need to calculate $b$. This is done by multiplying both sides of the constraint that support vectors have by $y_{SV}$ and solving for $b$:

$$y_{SV}(w\cdot x_{SV} + b) - 1=0 \quad \Rightarrow\quad (w\cdot x_{SV} + b) - y_{SV}=0 \quad \Rightarrow\quad b=y_{SV} - w\cdot x_{SV}$$

Plugging in $w=\sum_i^m \lambda_i y_i x_i$, we get the following:

$$b=y_{SV} - \sum_i^m \lambda_i y_i (x_i\cdot x_{SV})$$

Now we just need to find a data point that's a support vector, and we can use it to calculate $b$. This can be done by using a property of the $\lambda$'s. In KKT, the $\lambda$ multipliers for inequality constraints are only positive if they constrain the optimization problem or in other words, affect the location of the minimum. This makes sense as constraints that don't constrain the optimization problem, don't need to be considered and can therefore be nullified by setting their $\lambda$ multiplier to 0. For a better explanation, I'd recommend reading [this paper](http://people.duke.edu/~hpgavin/cee201/LagrangeMultipliers.pdf). In the context of our problem, the constraints that constrain the optimization problem are the ones generated by support vectors. Based on this, a data point with a respective $\lambda$ that's greater than 0 will be a support vector.

For our program, we will actually require the $\lambda$ to be greater than $10^{-4}$. This is because the CVXOPT doesn't set any $\lambda$ to $0$, but rather gets them very close (like $10^{-8}$). By requiring the multiplier to be "sufficiently" greater than $0$, we ensure that non-support vectors aren't selected.
